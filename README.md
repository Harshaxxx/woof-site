# Woof Landing (Pre-launch)

Public marketing + investor landing for Woof.

## What this is
- Static site (no framework, no backend)
- Hosted on Vercel
- Domain planned: \`woof.cool\`
- Contact CTA: \`invest@woof.cool\`

## Core pitch
- Walk, connect, play, earn — in one app.
- Packs (recurring walking groups w/ RSVPs & roles)
- Woof Map (live local dog activity, safe meetup zones, partner perks, Bone drops)
- Bones economy (IRL reward currency you redeem with local partners)
- IRL Games (Sniffari, Bone Hunt, Walk Wars, Photo Proof)
- Safety layer (Duo Check, controlled visibility, auto cutoff of live location)
- Beyond Walking (Marketplace, Insurance Hub, Care & Reminders, Social Feed, Dog Profile Matching)

## Structure
- \`index.html\` — main marketing page with sticky Woof Map
- \`privacy.html\` / \`terms.html\` — lightweight policies so those links don't 404
- \`assets/logo.png\` — Woof paw logo (yellow, no text inside) [placeholder right now]
- \`assets/map.png\` — Woof Map mock (GTA-style view of zones, partners, packs)

## Notes
- Tailwind is loaded via CDN in \`index.html\`, \`privacy.html\`, \`terms.html\`
- No build step required
